# Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration


## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, I used RandomForest to classify exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In this homework assignment, you will need to:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-RandomForestModel-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

## Instructions

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocessed the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Performed feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Used `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separated the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Used `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tuned and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).
